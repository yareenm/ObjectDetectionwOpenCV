Object detection in images and webcam with OpenCV and Python on Pycharm

Hello!!
I did object detection on images and webcam. I used OpenCV and python for it.
Firstly, I tried the algorithm on images. After that I move forward with the webcam.
coco.names is the text file that contains class names. So, you can type whatever you want to be detect.
The other files is pre-prepared files you can obtain from me or on the web.

Thank you.
